# Tom's repository of random bits and pieces.

I used github's "automatic repo name generator".

I have a lot of snippets of code floating around that really ought
to be in version control, but aren't because they're also not "big"
enough to be their own projects.

So I think I'll try to use this repository as my "bits and bobs"
monorepo for things that don't need to be private, and don't (yet)
deserve to be in their own repositories.
